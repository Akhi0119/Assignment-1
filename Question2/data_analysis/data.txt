Data Visualization and Analysis of Student Performance Dataset
I performed five different data visualizations to analyze student performance across various factors, making specific insights more accessible.
1.	Pie Chart - Race/Ethnicity Distribution:
•	This visualization makes it easier to understand the demographic composition of the student population
•	Shows the proportional representation of different racial/ethnic groups
•	Quickly identifies which groups are majority/minority
•	Helps in assessing diversity and representation in the dataset
•	Useful for identifying if any group needs additional support or resources
2.	Bar Plot - Gender Distribution:
•	Provides a clear comparison of male vs female student counts
•	The exact numbers on top of bars make it easy to see the precise gender balance
•	Helps identify if there's gender disparity in the student population
•	Useful for gender-based policy making and resource allocation
•	Makes it simple to spot if any gender is underrepresented
3.	Swarm Plots - Subject Scores by Gender:
•	Shows the detailed distribution of scores in each subject (Math, Reading, Writing) by gender
•	Helps identify gender-based performance patterns in different subjects
•	Makes it easy to spot outliers and score ranges
•	Shows if there are any gender-based achievement gaps
•	Useful for developing targeted academic interventions
4.	Box Plot - Average Scores by Gender:
•	Displays the statistical distribution of average scores between genders
•	Shows median, quartiles, and outliers clearly
•	Makes it easy to compare overall academic performance between genders
•	Helps identify if there's a significant performance gap between genders
•	Useful for understanding score variability within each gender group
5.	Bar Plot - Parental Education vs Average Score:
•	Shows the relationship between parental education and student performance
•	Makes it easy to identify which parental education levels correlate with higher/lower student scores
•	Helps understand the impact of family background on academic performance
•	Useful for developing targeted support programs based on family background
•	Aids in identifying where additional educational support might be needed
These visualizations together provide a comprehensive understanding of demographic factors affecting student performance and help in data-driven decision-making for educational improvements.
